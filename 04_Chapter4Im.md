# Chapter 4: Implementing Transformer-based models for machine translation

## The Tale of Polyglottes

Once upon a time in a land of many tongues, there lived a young girl named Polyglottes. She was blessed with the gift of language and could speak every language spoken in the known world. Her fame spread far and wide, and people traveled from far-off lands to hear her speak in their native tongues. 

However, one day, Polyglottes received a visit from a foreign king who spoke a language she had never heard before. She was determined to learn this language so she could converse with the king, but no matter how hard she tried, she could not decipher its meaning. 

Desperate to communicate with the king, Polyglottes sought the counsel of the Oracle of Natural Language Processing. The oracle told her of the great power of the Transformer model, and how it had the ability to translate multiple languages with ease.

With the wisdom of the Oracle and the help of Vaswani, the creator of the Transformer model, Polyglottes set forth on a quest to implement a Transformer-based model for machine translation.

## The Journey Begins

Polyglottes knew that the first step in her quest was to obtain the necessary tools for the journey. So she turned to PyTorch, the trusty companion of all who sought to harness the power of the Transformer model. 

With the guidance of Vaswani, she learned how to implement the Transformer architecture and prepare the data for training. Together they built a machine translation model that could translate between languages with great accuracy and speed.

## The Final Test

As Polyglottes approached the king, she felt a sense of excitement and nervousness. Would her translation model be able to decipher the king's language? Or would she be left to rely on hand gestures and facial expressions?

With the help of her machine translation model, Polyglottes was able to understand and speak the king's language with ease. The king was amazed by her ability to communicate with him in his native tongue, and he invited her to visit his kingdom and learn more about his culture.

Polyglottes had succeeded in her quest, thanks to the power of the Transformer model and the guidance of Vaswani. She had expanded her linguistic abilities and made new friends in far-off lands.

## The Moral of the Story

The tale of Polyglottes teaches us the power of machine translation and the importance of cross-linguistic communication. With the help of PyTorch and the Transformer model, we are able to break down language barriers and communicate with people from all corners of the world.

So let us continue to harness the power of machine translation and strive for greater understanding and collaboration across languages and cultures.
The code used to resolve the Greek Mythology epic is based on PyTorch and the TensorFlow NMT tutorial which uses the Transformer architecture. 

For the data pre-processing, we use the Tokenizer function from the `nltk` library to encode the tokens. We then split the data into train and test sets using the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn` library.

For the model creation, we first define the embedding layer that maps the tokens to their respective vectors. We then add the encoder and decoder layers with multi-head attention, feed-forward layers, and normalization. Finally, we define the optimizer and loss function to train the model.

The code for training the model involves iterating through the train set and computing the loss and gradients at each iteration. We use PyTorch's automatic differentiation feature to compute the gradients and update the model weights.

For the evaluation, we use the test set and measure the accuracy and BLEU score of the model. BLEU is a metric commonly used for machine translation evaluation that measures how close the predicted translations are to the ground truth.

The following is sample code for training and evaluating the Transformer-based model for machine translation:
